## About

I play a lot of [Rummikub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummikub) with my family and friends. When game goes into final stages, it can take a lot of time for player to finish it's move. To make it easy for use to enforce time constrains, I created this timer.

Feel free to use it for other pourposes! 😅

## Features
It's just a timer, so there no so many features, here are highlights:

- 🌗 Dark/Light Mode
- 🔢 Keyboard Support
- 🕹️ Play/Pause/Resume/Stop Controls
- 🕘 Supports Hours/Minutes/Seconds
- 🧽 Clean and not-clogged UI
